# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Application of foundational Python skills to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data of Netflix.

#Project Description

In this project,I applied the skills i learnt in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I discovered if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I also gained experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots created of the data.
